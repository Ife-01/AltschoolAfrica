This project uses Linear Regression to predict housing sale prices from the dataset.

Approach
1. Exploratory Data Analysis

Examined data structure and missing values
Visualized distributions with histograms and boxplots
Created scatterplot of feature vs. SalePrice

2. Model Implementation

Applied Linear Regression (sklearn)
Split data into train/test sets
Fitted model and made predictions

3. Evaluation

RÂ² Score and RMSE

Key Results

Model explains %variance in SalePrice

Tools: Python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
